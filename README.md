# WeatherForecastApp
The Weather Forecasting Application is a simple Java program that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city. It displays temperature, pressure, humidity, and visibility, using basic string parsing. Users need to insert their own API key for the app to function correctly.
